# Etch-a-Sketch
This project was done to practice DOM manipulation using Javascript.

A grid of squares is created and its colour can be changed by hovering your mouse over it.
Additionally, the size of the grid can be changed by clicking the button at the top of the page and typing in the desired size of the next grid.
